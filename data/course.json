  "course_description": "As the course title suggests, this class is meant to acquaint you with the literary and rhetorical tradition of the essay, a genre which has been described by one scholar as \"the meeting ground between art and philosophy,\" and by another as \"the place where the self finds a pattern in the world, and the world finds a pattern in the self\". Though the essay is part of a tradition of prose which stretches back to antiquity, it is also a thoroughly modern and popular form of writing, found in print media and on the web.\n",
